  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required features for the ZENTEK e-commerce app. Frontend pages, contexts, components, and routing are all present. The backend Motoko actor exists but uses incorrect seeded product data (wrong names, images, prices) instead of the 5 specified ZENTEK products. Several pages referenced in App.tsx were omitted from the diff due to truncation limits, making full verification difficult for those pages.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Backend Motoko actor must seed all 5 ZENTEK products with correct names, imageUrls, prices, MRPs, descriptions, keyFeatures, and codAvailable flags (AuraBuds Pro, NightDock, SnapGrip, HyperKey, LumiCam).",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo seeds products named 'ZENTEK Solar Power Bank', 'ZENTEK UV Water Purifier', 'ZENTEK Eco-Friendly LED Bulbs', etc. — not the required 5 ZENTEK products with their specified prices and image URLs.",
